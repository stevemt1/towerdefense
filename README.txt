Summary:
Our game is a lane/tower defense game where the players combat each other and try to get 5 minions into the other player’s castle. Each of the players have a unique skill which allows for different strategies and variability to the gameplay.
Play the game at 1280 x 800.
Also, we did not implement an in game scene restart button because we found it was easy for players who knew about it to rage quit, so we made a the game loop so after someone has won the game, you can restart and play again!


Player Experience:
As our game evolved, we wanted the players to get excited with the competitive gameplay and have loads of fun playing with different characters and seeing other player’s strategies. There’s also a sense of urgency when other players summon multiple minions and they’re close to their opponent’s castle. The game is intense and always ends with screams and excitement.
